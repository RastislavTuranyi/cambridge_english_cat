And teenagers might come (3) .......... other towns to join us, too.\n\nSo I set up an online questionnaire to find out (4) .......... local people wanted. I asked them whether we should improve our old skatepark (5) .......... build a completely new one. People voted to build a new one.\n\nThen we held some events to get money to pay for it. In the end we collected half the cost, and the local council paid the rest. It (6) .......... finally finished last month. So come and try it – you’ll have a great time!

I’ve even seen bits of rock from the moon!\n\nThe building’s really beautiful and it’s easy to find your way around.

I’ve been twice in the school holidays and the queue was (4) .......... long that I wasn’t able to visit that part (5) .......... the museum.\n\nYou’ll probably want something to eat while you’re there. You can take (6) .......... own picnic and eat in the museum garden, or try one of the two museum cafés.
