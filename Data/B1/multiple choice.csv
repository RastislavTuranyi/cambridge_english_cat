Play to win;16-year-old Harry Moore writes about his hobby, tennis.;My parents have always loved tennis and they’re members of a tennis club. My older brother was really good at it and they supported him – taking him to lessons all the time. So I guess when I announced that I wanted to be a tennis champion when I grew up I just intended for them to notice me. My mother laughed. She knew I couldn’t possibly be serious, I was just a 4-year-old kid!\n\nLater, I joined the club’s junior coaching group and eventually took part in my first proper contest, confident that my team would do well. We won, which was fantastic, but I wasn’t so successful. I didn’t even want to be in the team photo because I didn’t feel I deserved to be. When my coach asked what happened in my final match, I didn’t know what to say. I couldn’t believe I’d lost – I knew I was the better player. But every time I attacked, the other player defended brilliantly. I couldn’t explain the result.;B;Harry thinks he said that he was going to be a tennis champion in order to;please his parents.;get some attention.;annoy his older brother.;persuade people that he was serious.

Play to win;16-year-old Harry Moore writes about his hobby, tennis.;After that, I decided to listen more carefully to my coach because he had lots of tips. I realised that you need the right attitude to be a winner. On court I have a plan but sometimes the other guy will do something unexpected so I’ll change it. If I lose a point, I do my best to forget it and find a way to win the next one.\n\nAt tournaments, it’s impossible to avoid players who explode in anger.

Artist Peter Fuller talks about his hobby;;There’s a popular idea that artists are not supposed to be into sport, but mountain biking is a huge part of my life. It gets me out of my studio, and into the countryside. But more importantly, racing along as fast as you can leaves you no time to worry about anything that’s going on in your life. You’re too busy concentrating on not crashing. The only things you pay attention to are the pain in your legs and the rocks on the path in front of you.\n\nI’m in my sixties now, but I started cycling when I was a kid. In the summer my friends and I would ride our bikes into the woods and see who was brave enough to go down steep hills, or do big jumps. The bikes we had then weren’t built for that, and often broke, so I used to draw pictures of bikes with big thick tyres that would be strong enough for what we were doing. They looked just like modern mountain bikes. However, it wasn’t until many years later that someone actually invented one. By the 1980s, they were everywhere.;C;Peter enjoys mountain biking because;it gives him the opportunity to enjoy the views.;he can use the time to plan his work.;he is able to stop thinking about his problems.;it helps him to concentrate better.

Mountain biking seemed a fairly safe way to keep fit, so I took that up instead. I made a lot of friends, and got involved in racing, which gave me a reason to train hard.

As I go past I imagine how surprised they would be if they knew how old I am.;D;Peter says he returned to cycling after several years;because he had become unfit.;so that he could enter races.;in order to meet new people.;to replace an activity he had given up.
