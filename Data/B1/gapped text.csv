Planting trees;by Mark Rotheram, aged 13;This spring, our teacher suggested we should get involved in a green project and plant some trees around the school. Everyone thought it was a great idea, so we started looking online for the best trees to buy. (1) .......... If we wanted them to grow properly, they had to be the right type – but there were so many different ones available! So our teacher suggested that we should look for trees that grew naturally in our part of the world. (2) .......... They’d also be more suitable for the wildlife here.\n\nThen we had to think about the best place for planting the trees. We learnt that trees are happiestwhere they have room to grow, with plenty of space for their branches. The trees might get damaged close to the school playgrounds, for example. (3) .......... Finally, we found a quiet corner close to the school garden – perfect!\n\nOnce we’d planted the trees, we knew we had to look after them carefully. We all took turns to check the leaves regularly and make sure they had no strange spots or marks on them. (4) .......... And we decided to check the following spring in case the leaves turned yellow too soon, as that could also mean the tree was sick.\n\nWe all knew that we wouldn’t be at the school anymore by the time the trees grew tall, and that was a bit sad. But we’d planted the trees to benefit not only the environment, but also future students at the school. (5) .......... And that thought really cheered us up!

So we tried to avoid areas where students were very active.;However, our parents did offer to help with the digging!;That could mean the tree had a disease.;But we soon found that choosing trees was quite complicated.;It can be quite good for young trees, though.;We knew they’d get as much pleasure from them as we had.;But at least we were doing it in the right season.;That way, the trees would be used to local conditions.
A new life;;I used to work as a college lecturer in the north of England, running photography courses. It wasn’t a bad job and I really liked my students, but I began to feel tired of doing the same thing every day. (1) .......... .\n\nI’d always loved travelling, so one weekend I typed ‘international volunteering’ into an internet search engine. At the top of the results page was the opportunity to go and stay on an island in the Indian Ocean, thousands of miles away, and help to protect the beaches and the sea life. (2) .......... I had some diving experience, and the more I talked about it, the more I wanted to do it. So I contacted the organisation. One week later they offered to send me to the island and I accepted. (3) .......... After all, the volunteer job was only for two months during the summer holidays. I thought after I’d finished, I’d come home.\n\nAs soon as I got to the island, I was sure I’d done the right thing. My first dive was incredible. (4) .......... I felt so lucky to be able to experience that every day.\n\nIn fact I loved it so much that I never came home! I’ve now been on the island for ten years and I have a permanent job. I’m working as a marine educator, teaching volunteers about the sea life and taking them snorkelling and diving. My desk is a picnic table 10 metres from the best beach on the island. Of course not everything about my new life is perfect. (5) .......... However, I can’t imagine going back to my old life.

That’s why I knew it was a terrible plan.;I had trained in icy water in the UK so the crystal clear warm water felt amazing.;They always ask lots of questions.;I work far harder than I used to.;I began joking to friends about sending in an application.;Afterwards, some people were surprised by my decision but I wasn’t too worried.;I decided I needed a break.;I needed to explain that first.
