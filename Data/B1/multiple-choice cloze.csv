Scientists have built a 300kph racing car that uses chocolate as a fuel! The project is ………… to show how car-making could become environmentally friendly. The car meets all racing car standards apart from its fuel. This is a mixture of waste chocolate and vegetable oil, and such ‘biofuels’ are not allowed in the sport yet. It has to be mixed with normal fuel so that all partsof the car keep working.;A;intended;wished;decided;insisted

Carrots and other root vegetables were used to make some parts inside and outside the car. Even the mirrors are made from potatoes! The sides of the car ………… a mixture of natural materials from plants as well as other recycled materials.;D;store;involve;collect;contain
The project is still young, so the scientists have not yet found out how ‘green’ the car is. They are planning many experiments to compare its ………… against that of normal racing cars.;B;operation;performance;display;technique
