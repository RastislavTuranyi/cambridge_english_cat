The origin of language;;The truth is, nobody really knows how language first began. Did we all start talking at around the same time (1) .......... of the manner in which our brains had begun to develop?\n\nAlthough there is a lack of clear evidence, people have come up with various theories about the origins of language. One recent theory is that human beings have evolved in (2) .......... a way that we are programmed for language from the moment of birth. In (3) .......... words, language came about as a result of an evolutionary change in our brains at some stage.\n\nLanguage (4) .......... well be programmed into the brain but, (5) .......... this, people still need stimulus from others around them.

This research shows, if (7) .......... else, that language is a social activity, not something invented (8) .......... isolation.

However, thinking instead of three potential solutions is a strategy which, according to research, provides a reliable way of finding a solution to the initial problem.\n\nAnother strategy advocates learning to avoid set patterns of routine behaviour. Something simple, (6) .......... taking another route to work at (7) .......... once a week, is seen as encouraging confidence in the face of uncertainty. (8) .......... the simplicity of these ideas, they nevertheless help prepare people mentally to manage major change if necessary.
