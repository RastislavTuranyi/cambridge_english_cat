Photography;Over the past one and a half centuries, photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity. During this relatively short history, the medium has expanded its capabilities in the recording of time and space, thus allowing human vision to be able to view the fleeting moment or to visualise both the vast and the minuscule. It has brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, as well as the social complexities and crises of modern life. Indeed, the photographic medium has provided one of the most important and influential means of capturing the essence of our being alive. Nonetheless, the recording of events by means of the visual image has a much longer history. The earliest creations of pictorial recording go as far back as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago and, although we cannot be sure of the exact purposes of the early cave paintings, pictorial images seem to be inextricably linked to human culture as we understand it.;A historical background;Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised concerning the supposed accuracy (or otherwise) of visual images, as well as their status in society. Ideas and debates concerning how we see the world and the status of its pictorial representations have been central political, philosophical and psychological issues from the time of Ancient Greece to the present-day technical revolution of the new media communications. Vision and representation have pursued interdependent trajectories, counter-influencing each other throughout history. The popular notion that ‘seeing is believing’ had always afforded special status to the visual image. So when the technology was invented, in the form of photography, the social and cultural impact was immense. Not only did it hold out the promise of providing a record of vision, but it had the capacity to make such representation enduring.;;In the mid-nineteenth century, the invention of photography appeared to offer the promise of ‘automatically’ providing an accurate visual record. It was seen not only as the culmination of visual representation but, quite simply, the camera was regarded as a machine that could provide a fixed image. And this image was considered to be a very close approximation to that which we actually see. Because of the camera’s perceived realism in its ability to replicate visual perception, it was assumed that all peoples would ‘naturally’ be able to understand photographs. This gave rise to the question of whether photography constituted a ‘universal language’. For example, a photograph of the heavens, whether it showed the sun and moon or the constellations, would immediately be understood in any part of the world. In the face of the rapid increase in global communications, we do need at least to ask to what extent the photographic image can penetrate through cultural differences in understanding.;;There are other questions that arise concerning the role of photography in society that have aimed to determine whether the camera operates as a mute, passive recorder of what is happening or whether it possesses the voice and power to instigate social change. We may further speculate whether the camera provides images that have a truly educational function or if it operates primarily as a source of amusement. In provoking such issues, the photographic debate reflects polarised arguments that traditionally have characterised much intellectual thought.;;The last 170 years have witnessed an ever- increasing influence of the visual image, culminating in the global primacy of television. For photography, the new prospects and uncertainties posed by digital storage and manipulation, and the transmission of images via the internet present new challenges. It has even been suggested that we now inhabit the ‘post-photographic era’ – where technological and cultural change have devalued photography to such an extent that events have taken us beyond the photograph’s use and value as a medium of communication. Furthermore, perhaps we should be asking if the advent of digital imagery means that photography, initially born from painting, has turned full circle and has now returned to emulating painting – its progenitor.
