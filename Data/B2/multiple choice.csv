;Extract from a novel in which a young woman called Caitlin talks about her life on an island.;We live on the island of Hale. It's about four kilometres long and two kilometres wide at its broadest point, and it's joined to the mainland by a causeway called the Stand - a narrow road built across the mouth of the river which separates us from the rest of the country. Most of the time you wouldn't know we're on an island because the river mouth between us and the mainland is just a vast stretch of tall grasses and brown mud. But when there's a high tide and the water rises a half a metre or so above the road and nothing can pass until the tide goes out again a few hours later, then you know it's an island.;C;What is Caitlin's main point about the island?;It can be dangerous to try to cross from the mainland.;It is much smaller than it looks from the mainland.;It is only completely cut off at certain times.;It can be a difficult place for people to live in.

My older brother, Dominic, had just finished his first year at university in a town 150 km away. Dominic's train was due in at five and he'd asked for a lift back from the station. Now, Dad normally hates being disturbed when he's writing (which is just about all the time), and he also hates having to go anywhere, but despite the typical sighs and moans – why can't he get a taxi? what's wrong with the bus? – I could tell by the sparkle in his eyes that he was really looking forward to seeing Dominic.;D;What does Caitlin suggest about her father?;His writing prevents him from doing things he wants to with his family.;His initial reaction to his son's request is different from usual.;His true feelings are easily hidden from his daughter.;His son's arrival is one event he will take time off for.

And when I say talking, I don't mean talking as in having a conversation, I mean talking as in jabbering like a mad thing. I didn't like it ... the way he spoke and waved his hands around as if he was some kind of intellectual or something. It was embarrassing.

Beyond the railings, the water was glinting with that wonderful silver light we sometimes get here in the late afternoon which lazes through to the early evening.;A;In the last paragraph, what is Caitlin's purpose in describing the island?;to express her positive feelings about it;to explain how the road was built;to illustrate what kind of weather was usual;to describe her journey home
;Extract from a novel in which a young woman called Caitlin talks about her life on an island.;We were about halfway across when I saw the boy. My first thought was how odd it was to see someone walking on the Stand. You don't often see people walking around here. Between Hale and Moulton (the nearest town about thirty kilometres away on the mainland), there's nothing but small cottages, farmland, heathland and a couple of hills. So islanders don't walk because of that. If they're going to Moulton they tend to take the bus. So the only pedestrians you're likely to see around here are walkers or bird-watchers. But even from a distance I could tell that the figure ahead didn't fit into either of these categories. I wasn't sure how I knew, I just did.;D;In the highlighted 'because of that', 'that' refers to the fact that;locals think it is odd to walk anywhere.;it is easier for people to take the bus than walk.;people have everything they need on the island.;there is nowhere in particular to walk to from the island.

He was actually a young man rather than a boy. Although he was on the small side, he wasn't as slight as I'd first thought. He wasn't exactly muscular, but he wasn't weedy-looking either. It's hard to explain. There was a sense of strength about him, a graceful strength that showed in his balance, the way he held himself, the way he walked....;C;What do we learn about Caitlin's reactions to the boy?;She felt his air of confidence contrasted with his physical appearance.;She was able to come up with a reason for him being there.;She realised her first impression of him was inaccurate.;She thought she had seen him somewhere before.
Kombat Kate;James Stanton meets ‘Kombat Kate’ Waters, who trains theatre actors in how to ‘fight’ on stage.;There must be few occasions when it would be really rude to refuse an invitation to head-butt someone you’ve just met!

To my amazement, I get it right. ‘That was good,’ says Waters. ‘Now maybe try it again without smiling.’\n\nWaters, known in the industry as Kombat Kate, is showing me how actors fight each other without getting hurt, and that includes sword-fighting. (She inspires fierce devotion: when I tweet that I’m meeting Waters, one actress friend responds: ‘She’s amazing. She taught me how to be a secret service agent in two days.’);A;How does the writer feel when Kate mentions the tin can?;worried about hurting Kate;relieved that Kate is just pretending;concerned that it may injure his head;convinced that he won’t take it seriously enough

She taught the cast how to fall down stairs without breaking any bones. One of the fight scenes is fairly close, Kate tells me, to the one we’re trying out now. ‘I’ve just slowed it down a bit,’ she says tactfully, before inviting me to throw her against the wall. I obey, making sure I let go of her quickly, so she can control her own movement. Push your opponent too hard, and they will hit the wall for real.

Already a keen martial arts expert from childhood, Kate did drama at university, and one module of her course introduced her to stage combat. When she made enquiries about the possibility of teaching it as a career, she was told about the register and the qualifications she’d need to be accepted onto it. It was <b>no small order<b>: as well as a certificate in advanced stage combat, she would need a black belt in karate and proficiency in fencing, a sport she’d never tried before.\n\nBut she rose to the challenge and taught the subject for several years at a drama college before going freelance and becoming a fight advisor for the theatrical world. The play she’s working on is Shakespeare’s Richard III. This involves a famous sword fight. With no instructions left by the great playwright other than – Enter Richard and Richmond: they fight, Richard dies – the style and sequence of the fight is down to Kate and the actors.;D;What does the phrase ‘no small order’ (highlighted) tell us about stage combat?;Kate knew she would love learning about it.;It is something very few people ever perfect.;Studying it required a lot of obedience and respect.;Qualifying to teach it would be a long and difficult process.

The scene has to be exciting and do something for the audience.’\n\nUltimately, of course, a stage fight is all smoke and mirrors. In our lesson, Kate shows me how an actor will stand with his or her back to the audience ahead of a choreographed slap or punch. When the slap comes it makes contact not with skin but with air: the actor whacks his chest or leg to make the sound of the slap.;A;What does the writer tell us about the sword fight in the play Richard III?;Its details need to be made up.;It’s a particularly challenging scene to do.;Its action is conveyed through spoken words.;It is widely agreed to be the most exciting of its kind.

Anyway, I’m an athlete, so since I was a little kid, I’ve heard it shouted every time I’ve done something right and every time I messed up, too. These days it’s on the back of my basketball jersey.
