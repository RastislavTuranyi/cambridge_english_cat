A;It’s my first time driving to Chelsea’s training ground and I turn off slightly too early at the London University playing fields. Had he accepted football’s rejections in his early teenage years, it is exactly the sort of ground Duncan Williams would have found himself running around on at weekends. At his current age of 18, he would have been a bright first-year undergraduate mixing his academic studies with a bit of football, rugby and cricket, given his early talent in all these sports. However, Duncan undoubtedly took the right path. Instead of studying, he is sitting with his father Gavin in one of the interview rooms at Chelsea’s training base reflecting on Saturday’s match against Manchester City. Such has been his rise to fame that it is with some disbelief that you listen to him describing how his career was nearly all over before it began.;B;Gavin, himself a fine footballer – a member of the national team in his time – and now a professional coach, sent Duncan to three professional clubs as a 14 year-old, but all three turned him down. ‘I worked with him a lot when he was around 12, and it was clear he had fantastic technique and skill. But then the other boys shot up in height and he didn’t. But I was still upset and surprised that no team seemed to want him, that they couldn’t see what he might develop into in time. When Chelsea accepted him as a junior, it was made clear to him that this was more of a last chance than a new beginning. They told him he had a lot of hard work to do and wasn’t part of their plans. Fortunately, that summer he just grew and grew, and got much stronger as well.’;C;Duncan takes up the story: ‘The first half of that season I played in the youth team. I got lucky – the first-team manager came to watch us play QPR, and though we lost 3-1, I had a really good game. I moved up to the first team after that performance.’ Gavin points out that it can be beneficial to be smaller and weaker when you are developing – it forces you to learn how to keep the ball better, how to use ‘quick feet’ to get out of tight spaces. ‘A couple of years ago, Duncan would run past an opponent as if he wasn’t there but then the other guy would close in on him. I used to say to him, “Look, if you can do that now, imagine what you’ll be like when you’re 17, 18 and you’re big and quick and they won’t be able to get near you.” If you’re a smaller player, you have to use your brain a lot more.’;D;Not every kid gets advice from an ex-England player over dinner, nor their own private training sessions. Now Duncan is following in Gavin’s footsteps. He has joined a national scheme where people like him give advice to ambitious young teenagers who are hoping to become professionals. He is an old head on young shoulders. Yet he’s also like a young kid in his enthusiasm. And fame has clearly not gone to his head - it would be hard to meet a more likeable, humble young man. So will he get to play for the national team? ‘One day I’d love to, but when that is, is for somebody else to decide.’ The way he is playing, that won’t be long.

Walking on waves;My journey to the sea began when I was tiny. My mum, who used to surf then, would sit me on one of her old boards and push me into the little waves in a few centimetres of water. We both soon realised I had an unstoppable appetite for the waves, something which has never faded. Soon after that we moved to a house which was almost on the beach. I could literally walk out of the garden into the sea. Living by the sea is something you never take for granted if you surf. I open the curtains in the morning and my heart leaps as I see the long perfect lines of waves rolling into the bay.;Sarah Whiteley talks about her love of surfing and how it began.;Being the only girl in the water when I was learning to surf never bothered me because I’d always been trying to keep up with an elder brother who was exceptionally good at sports. So there I was, a tiny little thing, itching to better my surfing by checking out other surfers and looking for new moves. I was surfing four times a day in the summer holidays, before and fter school right through the winter months as the temperatures dropped and the sea was really wild. I just couldn’t get enough of it.;;Things started to get competitive as I got older and stronger. I was tackling more challenging waves: faster, more powerful and more dangerous, but I was gaining confidence and building up my experience, and it was really rewarding to see myself improving. And that’s when the boys started to notice me, and they weren’t too sure how to cope with it. They seemed to think along the lines of ‘She’s only a girl – she won’t manage that wave, so I’ll get in there and show her how to do it.’ Convincing them that I could hold my own in the waves wasn’t going to happen overnight.;;Over time and after a few hair-raising moments, I made some friends and mutual respect blossomed between me and the guys who spent all their time in the waves with me. When I started pulling off some good moves on my surfboard and throwing a bit of spray on the waves, they began giving me a bit of credit, so that if I was going out when the surf was really big, they would shout out instructions to make sure I had the best chance. They knew I wasn’t messing about and that I was going for it out there. Things got really interesting when I went in for competitions. In fact, I entered every national surfing competition over ten years. Competition surfing can be extremely frustrating, since you can never guarantee waves at a certain time on a certain day, and there’s vast amounts of hanging around.;;Now I’ve set up a surf school and I’ve got a whole new perspective. When you start teaching something, you have to learn for yourself again. Everything you’ve been doing instinctively without really noticing for the last fifteen years has now got to be passed on, and it gets surprisingly detailed and tricky in parts. But it’s been fantastic introducing so many people to the sport, and it’s even better when you get to see their big grins when they stand up for the first time and ride a wave into the shore. Surfing has taken me all over the world and now it feels like it’s brought me home again.

Adam – Nature Camp;We helped on a nature reserve for a week. We did different things every day, but I did get a bit fed up because we had cheese sandwiches every lunchtime. I kept quiet about it though because I didn’t want to seem awkward. I was starving by twelve every day anyway, and it really was good fun, although we worked incredibly hard. One day, the schedule was changed at the last minute, and instead of our planned activity, we all helped the staff finish cutting the reeds by the lake. That was the toughest day – and also the best. They actually needed our help, we weren’t just being kept occupied. Every day, we took it in turns to cook, in teams of five. When it was our team’s turn, we made a simple dinner of pasta and salad for everyone. Judging by the fact that there was none left, we didn’t do too badly!;Sarah – Culture Camp;Every morning we had the same breakfast, and then cleaned up the camp. Nobody could opt out and it was only when it was all completely tidy that we could head off for the day. The first time we went into the city, we were split into teams and given lists of things to spot, like statues, squares and other landmarks. With some help from the local residents, it wasn’t too demanding – my team found almost all of the items on our list and came second. We also got to know our way around, so I thought it was a clever idea. I’d been worried I might miss my parents, but there was something going on nearly every minute and I hardly got time to think about them. We went to different museums and galleries in and around the city every day, and in the evenings we cooked or went out for pizzas. It was a great chance to learn about another country and its history.;Oliver – Language Camp;We stayed with families who had kids our own age, and because they were on a mid-term break they came with us on all the trips. So apart from when we were actually in a language class, we were spending time with our new friends. It was a great way to practise the language we had been working on in the classroom. We also had to do a quiz on the last day – we were put into teams and given clues to help us find places around the town. Our team finished early, so we waited for everyone else in a café in the main square. While we were there, a film crew arrived and started filming! I can’t wait to see it when it comes out – we were sitting outside, so we might even be in it!;Malika – Theatre Camp;We stayed in a youth centre in the suburbs, and went into the centre of town by bus every day. It was a good way to see a bit of the city, and it didn’t take long to get to the theatre where we had our classes. I loved the atmosphere in the old building, and we could wander around during our breaks and watch rehearsals. The actors we saw were brilliant, and it was inspiring to watch them before we went back into our own classes. The emphasis was definitely on having fun, but we still learned a great deal and I’m looking forward to putting it all into practice at my school drama club next term! The food at the centre could have been better, but I don’t think anyone minded much.

Lucy Walker;I won a national award for the work I did on a project to build an environmental centre made entirely out of green materials. It’s a 100% carbon neutral building, which means that all the building materials were reused or recycled. The centre is somewhere kids can learn how to take care of the environment, but I realised that not everyone would have the opportunity to visit it. I therefore created an online curriculum guide, so kids could also learn about the environment in their schools. I translated it into Spanish as well so that it could be available to more people. All this took two years and I did it because I have a great love for the outdoors and being in the midst of wildlife, I wanted other young people to be able to experience the same passion that I feel.;Justin Day;While hiking near my home, I noticed a plant I didn’t recognise growing along the side of the trail. My sister, a naturalist, told me the plant was an invasive, nonnative plant that is toxic to local wildlife. I then discovered that there are a number of different types of non-native plants in my area. Some excrete poisons into the ground so nothing can grow there for many years. I had to get permission from the local council to remove some of them, but I realised I couldn’t do it alone. So I set up an environmental organisation to recruit other teenagers to give me a hand. We all learnt how to properly identify, remove and dispose of the invasive plants. Our focus has mainly been on a plant called Dalmatian Toadflax, which is easier to pull up, so anyone can do it. We also work on replanting areas with native grass and wildflower seeds.;Josh Benito;After seeing an article in the newspaper about an environmental competition, I felt inspired to do something related to planting trees so I set up a project at my local primary school. I gave a presentation to the kids teaching them about the importance of taking care of the environment and how trees can help. Then, each of the 300 pupils was given two young trees: one to take home and plant in their garden, and one to give to a neighbour or friend. I think the project was an effective way of getting the message across to more people. Attached to each tree was information about helping the environment and the name of the project. This experience has taught me leadership skills and how to organise a large group. I have also learned many things from having to meet and talk with many different individuals.;Erica Klek;When I was at primary school, my friend and I got really involved in aluminium can recycling and we also did a project on the greenhouse effect. Later on at high school I helped co-ordinate an environmental event because I wanted to make more people aware of important issues. It’s our generation that’s going to make or break the environment. Some teenagers don’t know they’re doing the wrong things, and I want to help them understand. I recently prepared a guide for students interested in organising similar activities in their own schools, which has been distributed to most of the schools in my area. I’ve also been helping to replant trees after they were destroyed in a hurricane. Unfortunately, we lost a lot, both exotic and native species.
