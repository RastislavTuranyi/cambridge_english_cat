Good preparation leads to success in ballet dancing;A former classical ballet dancer explains what ballet training actually involves.;What we ballet dancers do is instinctive, but instinct learnt through a decade of training. A dancer’s life is hard to understand, and easy to misinterpret. Many a poet and novelist has tried to do so, but even they have chosen to interpret all the hard work and physical discipline as obsessive. And so the idea persists that dancers spend every waking hour in pain, bodies at breaking point, their smiles a pretence.\n\nAs a former dancer in the Royal Ballet Company here in Britain, I would beg to question this. (1) .......... . With expert teaching and daily practice, its various demands are easily within the capacity of the healthy human body. Contrary to popular belief, there is no need to break bones or tear muscles to achieve ballet positions. It is simply a question of sufficient conditioning of the muscular system.\n\nOver the course of my dancing life I worked my way through at least 10,000 ballet classes. I took my first at a school of dance at the age of seven and my last 36 years later at the Royal Opera House in London. In the years between, ballet class was the first thing I did every day. It starts at an early age, this daily ritual, because it has to. (2) .......... But for a ballet dancer in particular, this lengthy period has to come before the effects of adolescence set in, while maximum flexibility can still be achieved.\n\nThose first classes I took were remarkably similar to the last. In fact, taking into account the occasional new idea, ballet classes have changed little since 1820, when the details of ballet technique were first written down, and are easily recognised in any country. Starting with the left hand on the barre, the routine unrolls over some 75 minutes. (3) .......... Even the leading dancers have to do it.\n\nThese classes serve two distinct purposes: they are the way we warm our bodies and the mechanism by which we improve basic technique. In class after class, we prove the old saying that ‘practice makes perfect’. (4) .......... And it is also this daily repetition which enables us to strengthen the muscles required in jumping, spinning or lifting our legs to angles impossible to the average person.\n\nThe human body is designed to adapt to the demands we make of it, provided we make them carefully and over time. (5) .......... In the same way, all those years of classes add up to a fit-for-purpose dancing machine. This level of physical fluency doesn’t hurt; it feels good.\n\n(6) .......... But they should not be misled: there is a difference between hard work and hardship. Dancers have an everyday familiarity with the first. Hardship it isn’t.

Through endless tries at the usual exercises and frequent failures, ballet dancers develop the neural pathways in the brain necessary to control accurate, fast and smooth movement.;The ballet shoe offers some support, but the real strength is in the muscles, built up through training.;As technology takes away activity from the lives of many, perhaps the ballet dancer’s physicality is ever more difficult for most people to imagine.;Ballet technique is certainly extreme but it is not, in itself, dangerous.;The principle is identical in the gym – pushing yourself to the limit, but not beyond, will eventually bring the desired result.;No one avoids this: it is ballet’s great democratiser, the well established members of the company working alongside the newest recruits.;It takes at least a decade of high-quality, regular practice to become an expert in any physical discipline.
How the recycling symbol was created;Gary Anderson designed a symbol which we see everywhere nowadays.;I studied engineering at the University of Southern California at a time when there was a lot of emphasis in the United States on training young people to be engineers. That said, I eventually switched to architecture. I just couldn't get a grasp on electronics and architecture seemed more concrete to me.\n\nIt was around that time that I saw a poster advertising a design competition being run by the Container Corporation of America. The idea was to create a symbol to represent recycled paper. One of my college requirements had been a graphic design course so I thought I’d give it a go. It didn't take me long to come up with my design: only a day or two. (1) .......... But I already had arrows and angles in my mind because on my course I’d done a presentation on recycling waste water. I’d come up with a graphic that described this process very simply.\n\nThe problem with the design I’d done earlier was that it seemed flat, two-dimensional. So when I sat down to enter the competition, I thought back to a field trip in elementary school to a newspaper office where we’d been shown how paper was fed over rollers as it was printed. (2) .......... The three arrows in it look like strips of folded-over paper. I drew them in pencil, and then traced over everything in black ink. These days, with computer graphics packages, it’s rare that designs are quite so plain.\n\nI think I found out I’d won the competition in a letter. Was I excited? Well, yes of course – but not that excited. (3) .......... So it just seemed like, of course I would win! There was a monetary prize, though for the life of me I can’t remember how much it was... about $2,000?\n\nWhen I finished my studies, I decided to go into urban planning and I moved to Los Angeles. It seems funny, but I really played down the fact that I’d won this competition. I was afraid it would make me look as though I was interested in graphics, rather than urban planning. (4) .......... I remember seeing it once on a leaflet which had been produced on recycled paper, but then it disappeared.\n\nA while after graduating, I flew to Amsterdam for a holiday. I’ll never forget: when I walked off the plane, I saw my symbol. It was on a big recycling bin. And it was bigger than a beach ball! (5) .......... I was really taken aback. That was quite a long time ago though. Since then, I’ve got more qualifications and worked for quite a few different firms, some more environmentally aware than others.\n\nI feel much prouder of the recycling symbol now than I used to, probably because it’s so widely seen. Maybe this design has been more important to me than I’d thought. (6) .......... There’s more to me than the recycling symbol.
E;B;G;F;D;A
Still, I’d hate to think that my life’s work is defined by it.;I used what I’d seen to create the image.;I’m no expert on recycling but I can certainly see its value.;I hadn’t thought about it for years and there it was right in my face.;I realise that seems ridiculous for something that’s been so successful.;Also, nothing much happened to the symbol for a while.;I guess at that point in my life I had an exaggerated sense of my own importance.
Young Inventor;Schoolboy Tim Freeman has come up with a clever idea to improve the efficiency of school buses.;Tim Freeman was just twelve years old when he came up with a revolutionary idea that would make school buses more energy efficient. This would not only save money, but also help the environment. Five years later, the schoolboy finally saw his dream come true.\n\nIt all began when Tim did a short summer course on aerodynamics, the study of the movement of air around objects. (1) .......... He realised that the perfect candidate was his school bus. It had a very square front which meant it did not use petrol efficiently, only travelling 3km per litre, compared to a private car that can average about 8.5km per litre. He decided it was high time the vehicle was improved.\n\nAfter thinking about it for a while, Tim came up with the idea of attaching a large piece of strong transparent plastic to the front of the vehicle, covering the windscreen. It would help redirect the flow of air around the bus and thus make it move forwards more easily. (2) .......... At least, that was the theory.\n\nWhile his science teachers loved the idea, Tim needed to find enough money to build a model and test it. (3) .......... Helped by his older sister Alice, he managed to obtain a grant from an organisation that helps young people develop new ideas.\n\nOver the next year, Tim used the money to build a small-scale model of his invention. He did tests on it by attaching it to a mini toy school bus and seeing how it performed in a little wind tunnel he built in his garage. (4) .......... Because of this he knew he now needed to step it up and create a life-sized version that could be put to the test on a real bus.\n\nBy the time Tim was fifteen, he had set up a team of young engineers like himself, and been helped by his sister and his local community to obtain another grant to develop his idea further. While Tim and his team were able to build the initial versions, they soon realised that they needed some expert help to really get going. (5) .......... The person who volunteered was the one who had inspired Tim to start thinking about the project in the first place. She had taught him on the summer course when he was twelve. Along with two of her engineering students she worked with Tim through the summer to finally help him realise his dream.\n\nThe final version of Tim’s invention looks rather different from his original idea. Instead of a transparent piece of plastic that covers the windscreen of the bus, it is a smooth ramp-shaped ‘hat’ that gets fixed to the roof of the bus. (6) .......... In tests done on virtual and real roads it has helped increase the efficiency of school bus fuel use by 10-20%. Maybe this ingenious device will eventually help other buses and even cars become more fuel-efficient!

So they began writing to local universities to see if anyone would provide the advice and knowledge they needed.;This made it clear to them that the design would have to be changed.;This prompted him to look for a way to use what he had learned.;The data from these were good and his idea was looking promising.;He knew that was the only way to see if his design really worked.;This design provides the same benefits but costs less to manufacture and install.;In this way, the bus would become more energy efficient.
An amazing skateboard;The skateboard controlled by brainwaves that moves wherever you think it should.;Thinking of getting somewhere in a hurry? A new gadget from a company called Chaotic Moon Labs proves that the future of travel is only limited by the imagination. A skateboard they have developed, aptly named the Board Of Imagination, takes commands directly from the rider’s brainwaves and transfers them to a motor that propels the board forward. You just think of a destination, and how fast you would like to get there, and the Board Of Imagination will set off – hitting a top speed of around 50km per hour. If you think that’s too fast, it will slow down.\n\nA film on the internet of the board being put through its paces by the general manager of Chaotic Moon Labs, who refers to himself simply as ‘Whurley’, shows that he has mastered the art of thinking his way from Point A to Point B. The secret of his success is special software in an onboard computer – and a clever headset that monitors and interprets brainwaves. So far, he’s the world’s leading pilot of the board. (1) ..........\n\nOn the video, Whurley demonstrates how the board is handled. He gets on, looking relaxed and confident. (2) .......... As he puts it through its paces, he manages to hit fairly high speeds. The computer can be seen attached to the front of the board, and the motor is underneath. Whurley compares the process to imagining pulling yourself along with a rope. If you ‘see’ the destination in your mind, and how fast you want to get there, the Board Of Imagination's gadgetry will do the rest.;The whole concept started with another motorised board, called the Board of Awesomeness. That gadget used a tablet computer and an adapted computer games console to analyse hand movements. (3) .......... The new version is more sophisticated and uses a special wireless headset which can detect signals from the brain and process them.\n\nWhurley explains that the headset sends signals from the rider’s brain to the computer via a connector built into the headset. Then, software installed on the computer controls the electric motor. Of course, riders who want to use the board need to be able to balance. (4) ..........\n\nWhurley says this was a simple and painless process. He practised with just the headset and a computer so that a profile of how he ‘thinks’ could be made. That profile was then loaded onto the computer on the board. (5) .......... Thinking about lunch, or boring work could bring the board to an abrupt halt.\n\nSounding like a man speaking from painful experience, Whurley says: ‘We quickly realised that we would have to find a way to handle distraction. We’ve done the best we can to compensate. (6) .......... The only thing they can do is practise. Hopefully over time they can learn to focus.’
F;C;G;E;A;D
The only problem is that users really do have to keep their minds focussed.;As a result, they became easier to ride.;Then, the board seems to take off of its own accord.;However, it will always be an issue for most riders.;Apart from that basic requirement, they just have to get their brainwaves and the computer software to work together.;It’s clear, however, that there could be other skaters thinking themselves to various destinations in no time at all.;These were then converted into commands for the motor.
