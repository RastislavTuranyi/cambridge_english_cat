Motorbike stunt rider;;I work as a motorbike stunt rider – that is, I do tricks on my motorbike at shows. The Le Mans race track in France was (1) .......... I first saw some guys doing motorbike stunts. I’d never seen anyone riding a motorbike using just the back wheel before and I was (2) .......... impressed I went straight home and taught (3) .......... to do the same. It wasn’t very long before I began to earn my living at shows performing my own motorbike stunts.\n\nI have a degree (4) .......... mechanical engineering; this helps me to look at the physics (5) .......... lies behind each stunt. In addition to being responsible for design changes to the motorbike, I have to work (6) .......... every stunt I do. People often think that my work is very dangerous, but, apart (7) .......... some minor mechanical problem happening occasionally during a stunt, nothing ever goes wrong. I never feel in (8) .......... kind of danger because I’m very experienced.

From black pepper to chilli pepper;;In the 15th century, Europeans knew nothing of the chilli pepper, but they held black pepper in high regard and had used it in cooking since Greek and Roman times.

Camels;;The most distinctive feature of a camel is the hump, or humps, on its back. In these humps camels store fat (1) .......... is used as energy when they don’t have access to food. They can put (2) .......... with very difficult conditions, drinking only a little (3) .......... no water for up to seven days.

A History of surfing;;The history of surfing undoubtedly goes back a long way. It seems to (1) .......... formed a central part of the culture of the Polynesian people, who were inhabitants of islands in the Pacific Ocean (2) .......... as Samoa, Tonga and Hawaii. These people did not regard surfing (3) .......... a mere recreational activity. For them, it was much (4) .......... of an art.\n\nAlthough surfing disappeared from many parts of Polynesia in (5) .......... early twentieth century, a small number of people in Hawaii kept the tradition alive. In 1912, it spread to the east coast of the United States, and in particular to Virginia Beach, (6) .......... became an important surfing centre. Surfing developed quite rapidly from then on, and the design of surfboards became more sophisticated. However, (7) .......... was not until the 1960s that surfing came to be a truly global phenomenon, boosted not only by the success of surfing films (8) .......... also by pop songs about surfing culture.
