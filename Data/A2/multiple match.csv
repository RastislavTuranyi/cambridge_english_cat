Tasha;Last year I wrote for my college magazine, which I found really difficult, but I don’t think it’s hard to write a good blog. Mine is about things from daily life that make me laugh. My older brother also has a blog, but we’re writing about different subjects. We don’t discuss what we’re planning, but we read each other’s blogs sometimes. I like giving advice to people who write in asking for it – it’s good to know I’ve helped.;Dani;I started writing my popular film blog because I love movies. I like it when readers send me articles by email about a film they’ve seen, and I put these on my blog for everyone to read. I’m still at college, so I’m careful about spending too long on my blog, which is difficult as writing well takes time. I don’t think I’ll write it for much longer. I’m busy, and it’s time to do something new.;Chrissie;I began writing on a school magazine. I stopped after a few years, but I missed it, so I started my own – I’m still writing it now! The blog’s new for me, and I write about daily life. I get ideas from friends or my sister when I can’t decide what to write about – we always think of something interesting, sad or serious. At first, almost nobody visited my site, but now more do, I’ve had some lovely comments.

Below are students from a school gardens competition. Answer the question by choosing the correct person:
Whose class learnt about the garden competition from a TV programme?;Whose class grew some vegetables?;Whose class won a trip in the school garden competition?;Whose class painted flowers on their garden wall?;Whose class learnt about the insects in their garden?;Whose class got help from someone in a pupil’s family?;Whose class chose flowers that were the same colour?
Amy;Our class has just won a prize for our school garden in a competition – and they’re going to make a TV film about it! The judges liked our garden because the flowers are all different colours – and we painted some more on the wall around it. My cousin gave us advice about what to grow – she’s learning about gardening at college. We’re planning to grow some vegetables next year. I just hope the insects don’t eat them all!;Flora;Our teacher heard about the school garden competition on TV and told us about it. We decided to enter and won second prize! There’s a high wall in our garden where many red and yellow climbing flowers grow and it looks as pretty as a painting! Our prize is a visit to a special garden where there are lots of butterflies and other insects. My aunt works there and she says it’s amazing.;Louisa;The garden our class entered in the competition is very special. The flowers we’ve grown are all yellow! They look lovely on the video we made of the garden. We also grew lots of carrots and potatoes, and everyone says they taste fantastic. It was an interesting project. Our teacher taught us lots of things about the butterflies in our garden. We also watched a TV programme about them, and did some paintings to put on the classroom wall.
