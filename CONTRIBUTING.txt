Contributing new questions
==========================

Make sure you know which difficulty level your questions are. If you know it, go into the appropriate folder in Data/.
Inside are multiple CSV files based on the type of question. Please see below to know which question type you have
and how to append the file. All the files use SEMICOLON (;) as the separator.

gapped text
 - A text from which paragraphs or sentences have been removed and placed in jumbled order after the text. Candidates must decide 
   from where in the text the sentences have been removed.
	title;subtitle;full text
	correct answer to question 1;correct answer to question 2;etc.
	option 1;option 2;option 3;etc.
	    - full text = the text that the questions consists of, with the gaps present. All gaps must have the following
	                  formatting: (n) ..........
	                  where n is the number of the gap (counting from 1). There MUST be exactly 10 fullstops.

key word transformations
 - Several discrete items with a lead-in sentence and a gapped response to complete in 3–8 words including a given ‘key’ word.
	original text;keyword;text with gap;accepted answer 1; accepted answer 2;etc.

multipe choice
 - A text followed by six 4-option multiple‑choice questions.
   Question of this type consists of a text with multiple paragraphs that has only text and no interruptions (ie. no gaps). 
   Below the text are several multiple choice questions about the content of the text.
 - Each line should be formatted in the following way:
	title;subtitle;text;correct answer;question;choice 1;choice 2; choice 3; choice 4;etc.
		- if title and/or subtitle isn't present, leave the field empty (eg. ;;text... if neither is present)
		- text = usually two continuous paragraphs from the full text.
		- correct answer = the LETTER that is the correct answer. There must be only one.
		- question = the question or statement to be answered using one of the multiple choices (ie. the text following quesion number)

multiple match
 - A text, or several short texts, preceded by multiple-matching questions. Candidates must match a prompt to elements in the text.
 - Each section of questions (the whole multiple match question) should be formatted over four lines:
	instructions
	question 1; question 2; question 3;etc.
	title 1; text 1; title 2; text 2; title 3;text 3; etc.
	correct answer to question 1;correct answer to question 2; etc.

multiple-choice cloze
 - A single text with several gaps. Candidates must choose one word or phrase from a set of four to fill each gap.
	title;subtitle;full text
	correct answer 1;correct answer 2;correct answer 3;etc.
	question 1 option 1,question 1 option 2,question 1 option 3,question 1 option 4;question 2 option 1, question 2 option 2
	    - full text = the text as it comes in the question, with all the gaps included. The gaps should have the standardised form.
	    - all the options are in line #3, but note that options for 1 question are separated by commas (,), while questions
	      are separated by semicolons (;)

open cloze
 - A modified cloze test consisting of a text with several gaps. Candidates think of the word which best fits each gap.
	title;subtitle;full text
	question 1 accepted answer 1,question 1 accepted answer 2,etc.;question 2 accepted answer 1,etc.;etc.
	    - full text = the text as it comes in the question, with all the gaps included. The gaps should have the standardised form.
	    - all the answers are in line #2, but note that options for 1 question are separated by commas (,), while questions
	      are separated by semicolons (;)

 - Question of this type consists of multiple short, independent
	correct answer;question;choice 1;choice 2;choice 3;etc.

word formation
 - A text containing several gaps. Each gap corresponds to a word. The stems of the missing words are given beside 
   the text and must be changed to form the missing word.
    title;subtitle;full text
	question 1 accepted answer 1,question 1 accepted answer 2,etc.;question 2 accepted answer 1,etc.;etc.
	stem word 1;stem word 2;stem word 3;stem word 4;etc.

	        - PLEASE NOTE: the gap that is used as an example (denoted as 0) should be left at zero, then all following gaps
	                       should be numbered starting from 2
	    - all the answers are in line #2, but note that the various accepted answers for 1 question are separated by commas (,),
	      while questions are separated by semicolons (;)
