==========================

Make sure you know which difficulty level your questions are. If you know it, go into the appropriate folder in Data/.
Inside are multiple CSV files based on the type of question. Please see below to know which question type you have
and how to append the file. All the files use SEMICOLON (;) as the separator.

gapped text

   from where in the text the sentences have been removed.

	option 1;option 2;option 3;etc.
